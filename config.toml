Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science from UT Arlington, where I'm diving deep into the realms of big data and graphs databases. 
My current research is in the fields of data mining and data analysis in large graph datasets and multilayered networks, and even venturing into the world of parallel and distributed computing.
Prior to that I have over three years of real-world experience working on a range of projects across various domains.

When it comes to software development, I'm passionate about crafting effective and scalable solutions tailored to intricate business requirements. I aim to seamlessly integrate emerging technologies to not only boost application performance but also create remarkable user experiences.
